		In our chaplaincy, we are committed to the safeguarding and well-being of all â€” especially

		We believe that safeguarding is the responsibility of the whole church community. Whether you
		are a long-standing member or visiting us for the first time, your safety and dignity matter
		deeply to us. Our parish safeguarding team is here to help and respond to any concerns you may
		have.
