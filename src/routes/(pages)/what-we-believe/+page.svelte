		We belong to the Church of England, which is part of the wider Anglican Communion. The name “Anglican” means “of
		England”, but today Anglican churches are found all over the world. Together with all Christians, Anglicans hope,
		pray and work for the coming of the reign of God.

		Belief in God as Father, Son and Holy Spirit is at the heart of our faith. We believe that God has revealed himself
		through the Bible. God has revealed himself most clearly through the gift of his Son, Jesus Christ. God makes
		himself known personally to each believer through the work of the Holy Spirit.

		We adhere to the Nicene Creed and the Apostles’ Creed as basic statements of Christian belief. We recognise baptism
		and Eucharist as the church’s two fundamental sacraments. We welcome all baptized Christians of any denomination to
		receive the Eucharist with us. If you would like to know more about baptism and what it means to be Christian, get
		in touch with our chaplain. We are all exploring God’s world and his relationship with us. Will you join us on the
		journey?
