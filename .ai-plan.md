# AI Development Plan - Unified Image Handling System

## Current Status
- **Last Updated**: 2025-07-03T15:03:00+02:00
- **Active Session**: Unified Image Handling Implementation
- **Branch**: main
- **Overall Progress**: COMPLETED ‚úÖ

## üéØ PROJECT GOALS - COMPLETED ‚úÖ
**Unify image handling across Events and News admin workflows:**
a) Simplify UploadImage component to return File objects via explicit callbacks
b) Remove global store dependencies and implement explicit data flows
c) Ensure consistent image upload and metadata handling across all forms
d) Maintain image metadata (alt text, caption) reuse functionality

## üìã PROJECT PHASES - ALL COMPLETED ‚úÖ

### Phase 1: Analysis & Design - COMPLETED ‚úÖ
- [x] **Analyze existing image handling patterns**
  - [x] Reviewed UploadImage component buffering logic
  - [x] Identified differences between EventForm and NewsForm workflows
  - [x] Documented global store dependencies and issues
- [x] **Design unified approach**
  - [x] Two-callback pattern for UploadImage (onNewFileSelected, onExistingFileSelected)
  - [x] Parent forms manage all image state and metadata
  - [x] Explicit data flows instead of global stores

### Phase 2: Component Refactoring - COMPLETED ‚úÖ
- [x] **UploadImage component**
  - [x] Refactored to only return File objects or StorageReferences
  - [x] Removed global store dependencies
  - [x] Implemented two-callback pattern for clarity
- [x] **EventForm component**
  - [x] Added newImage state tracking
  - [x] Updated handlers for new/existing image selection
  - [x] Integrated metadata retrieval from Firebase Storage
- [x] **NewsForm component**
  - [x] Applied same unified pattern as EventForm
  - [x] Updated all handlers to pass newImage parameter

### Phase 3: Service Layer Updates - COMPLETED ‚úÖ
- [x] **EventFormService**
  - [x] Created uploadEventImage function
  - [x] Removed global store dependencies
  - [x] Fixed serialization issues (store fullPath instead of StorageReference)
  - [x] Proper error handling and alt text validation
- [x] **NewsFormService**
  - [x] Created uploadNewsImage function
  - [x] Mirrored EventFormService pattern
  - [x] Integrated with existing newsFormService workflow

### Phase 4: Admin Page Integration - COMPLETED ‚úÖ
- [x] **Event admin pages**
  - [x] Updated create page to use uploadEventImage
  - [x] Updated edit page to handle newImage parameter
  - [x] Fixed variable assignment issues
- [x] **News admin pages**
  - [x] Updated create page to use uploadNewsImage
  - [x] Updated edit page to handle newImage parameter
  - [x] Cleaned up old store references

## IMPLEMENTATION HIGHLIGHTS

### Key Architectural Changes
- **Explicit Data Flow**: Replaced hidden global stores with explicit parameter passing
- **Two-Callback Pattern**: Clear separation between new file selection and existing image selection
- **Centralized Upload Logic**: `uploadEventImage` and `uploadNewsImage` functions handle all upload concerns
- **Metadata Preservation**: Alt text and captions retrieved from Firebase Storage metadata when reusing images
- **Type Safety**: Proper TypeScript types throughout the workflow

### Technical Improvements
- **Fixed Serialization**: Store `fullPath` strings instead of StorageReference objects in Firestore
- **Proper URL Handling**: Use download URLs returned by upload functions directly
- **Error Handling**: Alt text validation enforced during upload
- **Code Organization**: Clear separation of concerns between components and services

### Files Modified
- `src/lib/components/UploadImage.svelte` - Two-callback refactor
- `src/lib/components/EventForm.svelte` - Unified image state management
- `src/lib/components/NewsForm.svelte` - Applied same pattern as EventForm
- `src/lib/services/EventFormService.ts` - Added uploadEventImage function
- `src/lib/services/NewsFormService.ts` - Added uploadNewsImage function
- `src/routes/(admin)/admin/eventsadmin/create/+page.svelte` - Integrated new workflow
- `src/routes/(admin)/admin/eventsadmin/[eventId]/+page.svelte` - Updated edit workflow
- `src/routes/(admin)/admin/newsadmin/create/+page.svelte` - Integrated new workflow
- `src/routes/(admin)/admin/newsadmin/[newsId]/+page.svelte` - Updated edit workflow

## PROJECT STATUS: COMPLETE

**All unified image handling objectives have been successfully implemented and tested.**

Both Event and News workflows now use consistent, maintainable image handling patterns with explicit data flows and proper metadata management.
- **UI Framework**: SvelteKit with shadcn/ui components
- **Authentication**: Existing admin auth system

**Data Flow:**
1. **Fetch**: Retrieve media list from Firestore Storage
2. **Metadata**: Load custom metadata for each media item
3. **Display**: Render in responsive grid/list with previews
4. **Edit**: Allow inline editing of metadata fields
5. **Save**: Update metadata back to storage

## üìä Progress Tracking
- Phase 1: üîÑ **Research & Planning** (In Progress)
- Phase 2: ‚è≥ Backend Infrastructure (Pending)
- Phase 3: ‚è≥ Frontend Components (Pending)  
- Phase 4: ‚è≥ Management Actions (Pending)

## üéØ Project Scope
**Building a comprehensive media management system for admin users**

### Core Features:
- üìã **Media Listing**: View all stored media in organized layout
- üñºÔ∏è **Preview System**: Full-size previews with navigation
- ‚úèÔ∏è **Metadata Editing**: Edit imageAlt and imageCaption inline
- üóÇÔ∏è **Management Tools**: Delete, organize, and manage media files

### Technical Goals:
- Leverage existing Firestore Storage infrastructure
- Utilize shadcn/ui components for consistent UI
- Implement custom metadata storage and retrieval
- Create reusable media management components

## üìå Context & Navigation
- User can ask questions and return to plan with "Take me back to my plan"
- Focus on systematic, step-by-step development
- Plan allows for contextual help and clarification at each step
