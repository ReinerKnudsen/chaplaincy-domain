			The FACBC e.V. is a legal entity and a registered association governed by German law. The main
			purpose of the FACBC is to collect all regular income and to pay all regular expenses.
		</p>
		<p>
			The chaplaincy receives a small income from special events such as bazaars, summer fetes and
			concerts.
		</p>
		<p>
			We receive no church tax or any other financial contribution from the state or diocese. As a
			result, we rely heavily on private donations from members of our community.
		</p>
		<p>
			You might notice that during the offertory hymn, not everyone will place an offering in the
			basket. This is because most members of the chaplaincy give through their bank by standing
			order.
		</p>
		<p>
			If you wish to make a donation, the FACBC e.V. will issue a donation receipt for tax purposes.
