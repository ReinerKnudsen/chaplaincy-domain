## ✅ COMPLETED MIGRATIONS

### Phase 1: Button Migration - COMPLETE 
- [x] shadcn/ui installation and setup
- [x] Button component installation and customization
- [x] **ALL** DaisyUI buttons migrated across entire codebase
- [x] Navigation components (NavigationItem, NavigationRollUp)
- [x] Authentication pages (login, passwordreset, register/makeadmin)
- [x] Admin pages (eventsadmin, newsadmin, locationsadmin, useradmin)
- [x] Form components (EventForm, NewsForm, NewLocationForm, UserForm)
- [x] Weekly sheet pages
- [x] All remaining components and test pages

### Phase 2: Input & Label Migration - COMPLETE 
- [x] shadcn/ui Input and Label components installed
- [x] **ALL** DaisyUI inputs and labels migrated:
  - [x] `/login/+page.svelte`
  - [x] `/passwordreset/+page.svelte`
  - [x] `/admin/weeklysheet/upload/+page.svelte`
  - [x] `UserForm.svelte`
  - [x] `EventForm.svelte`
  - [x] `NewsForm.svelte`
  - [x] `NewLocationForm.svelte`
- [x] Improved accessibility with proper label associations
- [x] Table classes confirmed as custom CSS (not DaisyUI)

### Phase 3: Modal Migration - COMPLETE 
- [x] Created reusable `ConfirmDialog.svelte` component
- [x] Built on shadcn/ui Dialog components
- [x] Migrated all admin confirmation modals:
  - [x] `/admin/newsadmin/+page.svelte` - Delete confirmation
  - [x] `/admin/eventsadmin/+page.svelte` - Delete + Duplicate confirmations
  - [x] `/admin/locationsadmin/+page.svelte` - Delete confirmation
- [x] Replaced native browser navigation warnings with ConfirmDialog:
  - [x] Event create/edit pages
  - [x] News create/edit pages
- [x] No more DaisyUI modal classes in codebase
- [x] Consistent UX, accessibility, and maintainability

##  CURRENT WORK

### Change Verification System Extension
- [x] Implemented in EventForm, NewsForm, UserForm
- [ ] **IN PROGRESS**: NewLocationForm.svelte change verification
  - [x] Added onUnsavedChangesUpdate prop
  - [x] Added change detection logic with hash comparison
  - [ ] **TESTING NEEDED**: Verify onblur event handlers work with shadcn/ui Input
  - [ ] May need to switch from onblur to oninput for change detection
- [ ] Extend to User admin pages (create/edit forms)

##  REMAINING TASKS

### Final Cleanup
- [ ] Scan for any remaining DaisyUI primitives (checkboxes, selects)
- [ ] Remove DaisyUI package and configuration
- [ ] Update documentation

### Future Enhancements
- [ ] Unit tests for ConfirmDialog component
- [ ] Step-by-step walkthrough capability
- [ ] Migration guide for future reference

## Context & Decisions
- User can ask questions at each step and return to plan with "take me back to my plan"
- Focus on primitives only: button, input, label, checkbox, select
- Some components (EventForm, NewsForm, NewLocationForm) may already be migrated - need verification
- Plan allows for step-by-step walkthrough with contextual help

## Technical Notes
- Repository: chaplaincy-domain
- Current branch: 172-install-shadcnui
- shadcn/ui Button component already installed and customized
- Need to install: Input, Label, Checkbox, Select components as needed

## TODO Items
- [ ] Install and configure shadcn/ui Input component
- [ ] Install and configure shadcn/ui Label component
- [ ] Install and configure shadcn/ui Checkbox component
- [ ] Install and configure shadcn/ui Select component
- [ ] Consider creating a custom DaisyUI-to-shadcn/ui migration guide for future reference
