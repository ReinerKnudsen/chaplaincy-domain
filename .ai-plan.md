# AI Development Plan - Media Management System

## Current Status
- **Last Updated**: 2025-07-01T18:15:00+02:00
- **Active Session**: Media Management Development
- **Branch**: TBD
- **Overall Progress**: Starting Phase

## 🎯 PROJECT GOALS
**Build a comprehensive media management system for admin users:**
a) Utilize custom media metadata for "imageAlt" and "imageCaption"
b) Create a page to list, preview and manage media elements on Firestore storage

## 📋 PROJECT PHASES

### Phase 1: Research & Planning - IN PROGRESS 🔄
- [ ] **Examine existing media management setup**
  - [ ] Review current `/admin/mediamanagement/+page.svelte`
  - [ ] Analyze existing Firestore storage structure
  - [ ] Document current media upload/storage patterns
- [ ] **Define metadata schema**
  - [ ] Plan imageAlt and imageCaption field structure
  - [ ] Determine storage location (Firestore metadata vs custom collection)
  - [ ] Design metadata update/retrieval patterns

### Phase 2: Backend Infrastructure - PENDING ⏳
- [ ] **Custom metadata implementation**
  - [ ] Create functions to read/write imageAlt and imageCaption
  - [ ] Integrate with existing storage service
  - [ ] Add metadata validation and error handling
- [ ] **Media listing service**
  - [ ] Create service to fetch all media from Firestore storage
  - [ ] Include metadata in media objects
  - [ ] Add filtering and search capabilities

### Phase 3: Frontend Components - PENDING ⏳
- [ ] **Media list view**
  - [ ] Create responsive grid/list layout for media items
  - [ ] Add thumbnail previews for images
  - [ ] Include metadata display (alt text, caption)
- [ ] **Media preview functionality**
  - [ ] Full-size image preview modal
  - [ ] Support for different media types
  - [ ] Navigation between media items
- [ ] **Metadata editing interface**
  - [ ] Inline editing for imageAlt and imageCaption
  - [ ] Form validation and save functionality
  - [ ] Bulk editing capabilities

### Phase 4: Management Actions - PENDING ⏳
- [ ] **Media operations**
  - [ ] Delete media with confirmation
  - [ ] Rename/organize media files
  - [ ] Upload new media with metadata
- [ ] **Advanced features**
  - [ ] Search and filter by metadata
  - [ ] Usage tracking (where media is used)
  - [ ] Batch operations

## 🔄 CURRENT FOCUS - Phase 1: Research & Planning

### 📍 IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS:
1. **Examine existing setup** - Review current mediamanagement page structure
2. **Analyze Firestore storage** - Understand current media storage patterns
3. **Define metadata schema** - Plan imageAlt and imageCaption implementation

### 📋 KEY QUESTIONS TO RESOLVE:
- How is media currently stored in Firestore?
- What file types need to be supported?
- Where should custom metadata be stored?
- How do existing upload components handle metadata?
- What admin permissions are needed?

### 🎯 SUCCESS CRITERIA:
- Admin users can view all stored media in a clean interface
- Each media item displays with thumbnail and metadata
- imageAlt and imageCaption can be edited inline
- Media can be previewed, managed, and organized efficiently

## 🛠️ Technical Architecture

**Key File Locations:**
- Media management page: `/src/routes/(admin)/admin/mediamanagement/+page.svelte`
- Page load logic: `/src/routes/(admin)/admin/mediamanagement/+page.ts`
- Storage utilities: (to be determined)
- Media components: (to be created)

**Technology Stack:**
- **Storage**: Firestore Storage for media files
- **Metadata**: Custom metadata fields (imageAlt, imageCaption)
- **UI Framework**: SvelteKit with shadcn/ui components
- **Authentication**: Existing admin auth system

**Data Flow:**
1. **Fetch**: Retrieve media list from Firestore Storage
2. **Metadata**: Load custom metadata for each media item
3. **Display**: Render in responsive grid/list with previews
4. **Edit**: Allow inline editing of metadata fields
5. **Save**: Update metadata back to storage

## 📊 Progress Tracking
- Phase 1: 🔄 **Research & Planning** (In Progress)
- Phase 2: ⏳ Backend Infrastructure (Pending)
- Phase 3: ⏳ Frontend Components (Pending)  
- Phase 4: ⏳ Management Actions (Pending)

## 🎯 Project Scope
**Building a comprehensive media management system for admin users**

### Core Features:
- 📋 **Media Listing**: View all stored media in organized layout
- 🖼️ **Preview System**: Full-size previews with navigation
- ✏️ **Metadata Editing**: Edit imageAlt and imageCaption inline
- 🗂️ **Management Tools**: Delete, organize, and manage media files

### Technical Goals:
- Leverage existing Firestore Storage infrastructure
- Utilize shadcn/ui components for consistent UI
- Implement custom metadata storage and retrieval
- Create reusable media management components

## 📌 Context & Navigation
- User can ask questions and return to plan with "Take me back to my plan"
- Focus on systematic, step-by-step development
- Plan allows for contextual help and clarification at each step
