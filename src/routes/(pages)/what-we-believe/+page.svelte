	We belong to the Church of England, which is part of the wider Anglican Communion. The name “Anglican” means “of
	England”, but today Anglican churches are found all over the world. Together with all Christians, Anglicans hope, pray
	and work for the coming of the reign of God.

<div class="py-4 text-lg">
	Belief in God as Father, Son and Holy Spirit is at the heart of our faith. We believe that God has revealed himself
	through the Bible. God has revealed himself most clearly through the gift of his Son, Jesus Christ. God makes himself
	known personally to each believer through the work of the Holy Spirit.

	We adhere to the Nicene Creed and the Apostles’ Creed as basic statements of Christian belief. We recognise baptism
	and Eucharist as the church’s two fundamental sacraments. We welcome all baptized Christians of any denomination to
	receive the Eucharist with us. If you would like to know more about baptism and what it means to be Christian, get in
	touch with our chaplain. We are all exploring God’s world and his relationship with us. Will you join us on the
	journey?

			We believe in one God, the Father, the Almighty, <br />
			Maker of heaven and earth, of all that is, seen and unseen.
			<br />
			We believe in one Lord, Jesus Christ, the only Son of God, <br />
			Eternally begotten of the Father, God from God, Light from Light, true God from true God, <br />
			Begotten, not made, of one Being with the Father; <br />
			Through him all things were made.

		<p class="mt-2">
			For us and for our salvation He came down from heaven,<br />
			Was incarnate from the Holy Spirit and the Virgin Mary and was made man<br />
			For our sake He was crucified under Pontius Pilate; He suffered death and was buried.
			<br />On the third day He rose again in accordance with the Scriptures; <br />
			He ascended into heaven and is seated at the right hand of the Father. <br />
			He will come again in glory to judge the living and the dead, <br />
			And His kingdom will have no end.

		<p class="mt-2">
			We believe in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, the giver of life, <br />
			Who proceeds from the Father and the Son, <br />
			Who with the Father and the Son is worshipped and glorified, who has spoken through the prophets. <br />We believe
			in one holy catholic and apostolic Church. <br />We acknowledge one baptism for the forgiveness of sins. <br />We
			look for the resurrection of the dead, and the life of the world to come.
