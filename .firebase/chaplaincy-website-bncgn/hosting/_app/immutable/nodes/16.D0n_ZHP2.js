Germans play an active part
		in our parish life. Both congregations range from families with young children to senior
		citizens. Although the majority of our congregation is Anglican, a number of other denominations
		are represented whose members, being English speakers, also regard the churches in Cologne and
		Bonn as focal points for worship.</div> <div class="col-span-2 mb-5 text-left text-lg">We see this ethnically, culturally and denominationally very varied community as one of our
		major strengths. It helps to make the congregation more flexible and dynamic in its attitudes.
		In the main, our chaplaincy staff are volunteers from our congregation who take on different
		aspects managing and supporting our community, under the guidance and support of our chaplain.
		If you would like to get involved or support any of our activities in any way, please get in
		touch.</div> <figure class="image mx-10 max-h-60 justify-self-end svelte-zqz8ls"><img class="max-h-60" src="https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/chaplaincy-website-bncgn.appspot.com/o/images%2Fstock%2Fsupport.jpg?alt=media&amp;token=80cd44ae-4633-473e-9e8d-b65997a19d02" alt="a group of people talking"/> <figcaption class="text-center text-sm"><a href="https://unsplash.com/@vidarnm">Image by Vidar Nordli-Mathisen</a></figcaption></figure>`,l,s,u="Â ";return{c(){t=c("div"),t.innerHTML=h,r=v(),a=c("div"),a.innerHTML=d,l=v(),s=c("div"),s.textContent=u,this.h()},l(e){t=m(e,"DIV",{class:!0,"data-svelte-h":!0}),p(t)!=="svelte-cy24tx"&&(t.innerHTML=h),r=x(e),a=m(e,"DIV",{class:!0,"data-svelte-h":!0}),p(a)!=="svelte-ovhsrk"&&(a.innerHTML=d),l=x(e),s=m(e,"DIV",{class:!0,"data-svelte-h":!0}),p(s)!=="svelte-1cpt13z"&&(s.textContent=u),this.h()},h(){g(t,"class","my-3 w-full"),g(a,"class","fliesstext mx-auto mb-20 flex flex-col items-center md:grid md:grid-cols-3"),g(s,"class","mb-20")},m(e,i){o(e,t,i),o(e,r,i),o(e,a,i),o(e,l,i),o(e,s,i)},p:f,i:f,o:f,d(e){e&&(n(t),n(r),n(a),n(l),n(s))}}}class j extends k{constructor(t){super(),w(this,t,null,z,y,{})}}export{j as component};
